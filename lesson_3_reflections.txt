When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to work on different computers or collaborate.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Perhaps there are some changes that you don't want to be transferd to other computers. That whould also create constant trafic and you lose some of the controll of what to push.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork, repository clone made on GitHub used for working on other peoples code but not commiting to it directly. Clone to a local copy of repository on GitHub, to work localy.Branch alternative path on repository on local, for testing and new features etc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

To see and ceep track of chenges since the lst oull / fetch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Offline versions whould be the alternative, althow a bad one. I think it whould be easier if to use Git thus that's easier to track changes, where and why thay have been made. Git makes it only easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Thats a safty feature and also a way to test and see if the change is something you want to have later on but are not sure yet. To merge directly whit the master branch thats the soution to go if you are sure about the changes.
